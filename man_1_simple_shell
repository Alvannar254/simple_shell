.SH NAME
	.B hsh
- A simple UNIX command line interpreter (shell)
	.SH SYNOPSIS
	The shell is executed by typing ./hsh
	.br
	Then, it will wait for an input such as : command [arguments]
	.SH DESCRIPTION
	This shell is a project that mimics the behavior of a real shell. A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. This shell supports the execution of commands with their arguments, handles the PATH, and includes a few built-in commands.
	.br
	.B What hsh can do :
	.br
	- Executes any command with its arguments
	.br
	- Executes built-in commands
	.br
	- Handles the PATH
	.br
	- Handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D)
	.br
	- Handles the exit built-in, that exits the shell
	.br
	- Implements the env built-in, that prints the current environment
	.SH BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
	These are the available built-in functions :
	.br
	- exit : exit the shell
	.br
	- env : Display the environment variables
	.SH OPTIONS
	There are no options for the moment.
	.SH EXIT STATUS
	The exit value depends on how a function has terminated. Every error is identified by a certain value. On success it will always return 0.
	.SH RETURN VALUE
	Return 0 on success, otherwise it will return the exit value.
	.SH ENVIRONMENT
	- PATH
	.br
	- $?
	.br
	- $$
	.SH BUGS
	There are no known bugs at the moment.
	.SH EXAMPLE
	.B Two ways to execute our shell :
	.br
	.B The interactive mode :
	.br
	$ ./hsh
	.br
#cisfun$ /bin/ls
	.br
	hsh main.c shell.c
	.br
#cisfun$ exit
	.br
	$
	.br
	.B The non-interactive mode :
	.br
	$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
	.br
	hsh main.c shell.c
